# Data Wrangling and Janitorial Work
This tutorial builds on the Rvest and Rselenium tutorial by showing you how to prepare and clean text data for analysis.

## Previous Tutorials
This tutorial assumes that you have successfully completed the Rvest tutorial. You will also need to ensure that you're following the web scraping best practices from the optional Rselenium tutorial, being sure to respect the robots.txt files from websites you scrape. Tutorials:

## Text Mining with R
The example code and accompanying class demonstration are based on chapter 1 from [*Text Mining with R*](https://www.tidytextmining.com) by Julia Silge and David Robinson. This tutorial will cover the most common forms of text scrubbing, and will show you how to transform your text to the tidytext format for analysis.

## Other Important Packages
The accompanying class demonstration will also preview the TM package in R, the document term matrix, and other useful tools like stemming. While these tools are not immediately important to this week's workshop, they may be necessary for various aspects of your course projects as they continue to evolve.
